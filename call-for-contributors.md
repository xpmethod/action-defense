\#Feminism Vision and Philosophy

1. Quality content is king! Better yet, queen! We want to produce quality feminist-leaning content at the intersection of culture, society, politics, and art that people will want to consume and gladly support.

2. We envision Hashtag Feminism as the Bentley of online feminist publishing with Beyonce sitting comfortably in the passenger seat. We only drive quality.

3. All sides of the argument matter. All personal experiences are valid.

4. Smart > superficial. Sass > snark.

5. We explore feminist-leaning topics through media lenses. Media means text, images, and sound. Media means interactive. Media means the message.
