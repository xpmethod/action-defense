The #myNYPD fiasco may have just been bumped to second place in a Twitter race to show which police department is most out of touch with reality. Last Thursday, the Prince George’s County Police Department in Maryland announced a plan to live-tweet a prostitution sting this week, a decision that has been met with considerable pushback. Opponents are hijacking the Twitter hashtag #PGPDVice and tweeting their thoughts to @PGPDNews. HIPS, a harm reduction nonprofit serving sex workers, will live-tweet a day of service from its drop-in center and outreach van in response.

This afternoon, PGPD announced that they conducted their sting but chose not to tweet about it. They made no arrests, citing the publicity as an intended deterrent. Despite PGPD’s claims of success, others are less confident that this was the plan all along.
