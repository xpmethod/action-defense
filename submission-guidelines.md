## \#Feminism Vision and Philosophy

1. Quality content is king! Better yet, queen! We want to produce quality feminist-leaning content at the intersection of culture, society, politics, and art that people will want to consume and gladly support.

2. We envision Hashtag Feminism as the Bentley of online feminist publishing with Beyonce sitting comfortably in the passenger seat. We only drive quality.

3. All sides of the argument matter. All personal experiences are valid.

4. Smart > superficial. Sass > snark.

5. We explore feminist-leaning topics through media lenses. Media means text, images, and sound. Media means interactive. Media means the message.

## Contributor Guidelines

\#Shortreads

- Quality content is king! Better yet, queen!

- Maximum 500-word pieces. Opinion pieces are welcome. List pieces are welcome.

- Must ask a question at the end of the analysis.

- Consider all sides of the argument. Back up analysis with references (quotes + hyperlinks).

- Embed tweets inside of posts. If you want to embed a series of tweets from a single user, as a courtesy, ask for permission first. Same goes for Facebook and Storify.

## \#Longreads

- Quality content is king! Better yet, queen!

- 1,000-1,500 words. We will consider longer pieces, but only if they make the world a better place like Andrea Elliot’s New York Times piece Invisible Child and Monica Potts’ American Prospect piece What’s Killing Poor White Women?

- Take your time with the piece! Do not rush it. Think Beyonce!

- In addition to written work, contributors are expected to include a piece of media (video, photos, web media) to illustrate. Original media preferred, but not required.
